# AI-Powered Scientific Paper Review Tool
Answer questions from papers and back the answers with quotes from the paper. 

## 1. System Overview
The system is an open-source software tool designed to assist researchers in analyzing scientific papers using Large Language Models (LLMs). Its primary purpose is to automatically answer research questions about papers while providing verifiable sources for all responses.

## 2. Core Functionality Requirements

### 2.1 Paper Processing
- The system shall process one scientific paper at a time
- The system shall support PDF format as the primary input format
- The system shall maintain the original document structure and pagination
- The system shall extract and preserve the hierarchical structure of the document (sections, subsections, paragraphs)

### 2.2 LLM Integration
- The system shall support integration with multiple LLM providers:
  - OpenAI API
  - Google Gemini API
  - CloudAI API
- The system shall handle API authentication and rate limiting for each provider
- The system shall manage API costs through configurable usage limits
- The system shall maintain session context for each paper analysis

### 2.3 Question-Answer Processing
- The system shall accept multiple research questions as input
- The system shall process each question against the current paper
- The system shall generate answers using the selected LLM
- The system shall require the LLM to support each answer with direct quotes from the source paper
- The system shall validate that provided quotes exist in the original document

## 3. Quote Verification and Source Attribution

### 3.1 Quote Tracking
- The system shall implement a robust quote verification system
- The system shall maintain a database of extracted quotes with their source locations
- The system shall verify each LLM-provided quote against the original text
- The system shall flag any quotes that cannot be verified in the source document

### 3.2 Document Navigation
- The system shall assign unique identifiers to each paragraph in the document
- The system shall create a labeled version of the document with paragraph numbers
- The system shall maintain mapping between original and processed document versions
- The system shall provide quick navigation to source paragraphs using paragraph identifiers

### 3.3 Visual Reference System
- The system shall implement one of the following visualization methods:
  - Option A: Direct PDF highlighting
    - Highlight quoted sections in the original PDF
    - Maintain clickable links between answers and source quotes
  - Option B: HTML conversion
    - Convert PDF to HTML while preserving document structure
    - Implement highlighting in the HTML version
    - Maintain bidirectional links between HTML and original PDF

## 4. User Interface Requirements

### 4.1 Document Upload and Processing
- The system shall provide an interface for uploading PDF documents
- The system shall display document processing status and progress
- The system shall allow users to verify successful document parsing

### 4.2 Question Management
- The system shall provide an interface for entering multiple research questions
- The system shall allow questions to be saved and reused across different papers
- The system shall support question templates for common research queries

### 4.3 Results Display
- The system shall display answers with their supporting quotes
- The system shall show paragraph numbers for each quote
- The system shall provide direct links to jump to quote sources
- The system shall highlight relevant sections in the document viewer

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- The system shall process documents in a reasonable time frame (target: < 2 minutes for typical paper)
- The system shall handle papers up to 100 pages in length
- The system shall support concurrent processing of multiple questions

### 5.2 Reliability
- The system shall validate all quotes against source material
- The system shall maintain accuracy of paragraph numbering across document versions
- The system shall preserve document formatting during processing

### 5.3 Security
- The system shall handle API keys securely
- The system shall protect uploaded documents
- The system shall implement appropriate user authentication if deployed as a service

## 6. Integration Requirements
- The system shall provide an API for integration with other research tools
- The system shall support export of results in common formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)
- The system shall allow for plugin development to support additional LLM providers

## 7. Documentation Requirements
- The system shall include comprehensive API documentation
- The system shall provide user guides for researchers
- The system shall include installation and configuration guides
- The system shall maintain technical documentation for developers

## 8. Future Considerations
- Support for additional document formats beyond PDF
- Batch processing of multiple papers
- Integration with reference management systems
- Support for collaborative paper review
- Integration with academic search engines
